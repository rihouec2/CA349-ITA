# CA349-ITA

CA349 coursework is based on exploiting Fusion Tables to display a large volume of data in a graph or map format, in a topic of your choice. Students must find a dataset that is suited to a map based layout and use Fusion Tables to both display the data and allow for queries to filter the dataset visually.  Additionally, you should build a front end to access Fusion tables using the API provided by Google. The front end should be designed for User ease of use and allow the user to implement a number of querries.

Projects are completed in pairs and the process is as follows: 

 Email me the IDs and Names and a brief description of what you will do. I will confirm that this is a valid project and place details online in the approved list. 

 Use Fusion Tables to create your visualisation and write a companion document (3-4) pages with the following headings. 
•	Front Page: Student Names, IDs, url to GFT link 
•	Overview (motivation, what it is about etc.) 
•	Justification of the technology you used to build your front end.
•	Outline the architecture of your system.
•	How do I find and view the output 
•	How it works (how can I run your built-in queries, what they do) 

You will need a Google Account and access to Fusion Tables. 
•	Import your dataset 
•	Visualise in the form of a map or graph 
•	Customise to get good marks. 
•	You can use the following link to https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/fusiontables to figure out how to use API’s. 
•	Also use https://developers.google.com/fusiontables/docs/v2/using
